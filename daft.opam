synopsis: "DAFT Allows File Transfers"
description: """
Summary:
--------

Distributed file transfer application in user space.

Securely move data files during distributed computational experiments and
provide a global view of all files, even when there is no distributed
filesystem and probably faster than NFS for large files.

Available commands:
-------------------

    put filename: add/publish a given file into the system.

    bcast filename: equivalent to put then send the file to all nodes.

    get filename: retrieve a file previously published into the system.

    ls [-l]: list all files known to the system and optionally where
             their chunks are.
